Ongoing project
This project aims to fine-tune Stable Diffusion to hallucinate Kanji images for words that it has not seen. The biggest challenge that I'm trying to overcome is working with low computational resources.
Stable diffusion would be trained on data from [KanjiVG](https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/viewer.html). This project was inspired by work done by (enpitsu)[https://x.com/enpitsu/status/1610587513059684353?s=20]
